## "Hunt and Kill" Maze Generator

Following on the footsteps of my good friend [@douglasgimli](https://github.com/douglasgimli), I've decided to try and implement the Hunt and Kill maze generation algorithm in Clojure.

I've followed the links he described in [his implementation](https://github.com/douglasgimli/maze-generator-js) but I'll list them here because they're all great material.
